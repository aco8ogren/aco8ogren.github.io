## About Me

Welcome to my website! I am a math-minded mechanical engineer who likes to combine mechanics with machine learning, inference, and computational imaging. I recently received my PhD from Caltech in the Deparment of Mechanical and Civil Engineering, and prior to that received a double major in Engineering Mechanics and Applied Mathematics from the beautiful university between the lakes: University of Wisconsin - Madison.
